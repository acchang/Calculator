This is my solution to The Odin Project calculator project

After a 9-month hiatus, I'm returning to tweak this and re-orient myself with JS.

I want the calculator to clear previous operator instead of giving an error message when a new operator is pressed.


For github pages, I got an email "No `/docs` folder was found to build GitHub Pages".

So I went to https://github.com/acchang/Calculator/settings/pages
And changed Branch: master / (root) from Branch: master / docs

The calculator worked both ways from https://acchang.github.io/
